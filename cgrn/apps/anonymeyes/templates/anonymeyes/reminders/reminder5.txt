This is an automated reminder from the IPSOCG Coordinating Center.

Today is the last remaining day to enter {{ month }} month OUTCOMES DATA for your patient with UUID {{ patient.uuid }} who
you assessed on {{ patient.visual_acuity_date }}, and enrolled on {{ patient.created_at }}.

Outcome data can be recorded from {{ start_date }} ({{ month|add:-1 }} months from baseline assessment date), and MUST be
completed by {{ end_date }} ({{ month|add:1 }} months after baseline assessment date).

You can access the update page for this dataset here:

{{ patient_url }}

Click 'Update' to edit and then 'Add' in the Outcomes section.

Please note:
 - In judging whether IOP is 'controlled' or 'uncontrolled' your assessment should be determined not just be the IOP
measurement but, as indicated, by the whole clinical scenario taking into account optic disc appearance, corneal
diameter, axialÂ length, refraction, visual field stability etc.
 - Regarding medications, remember to record combination drops as 2 meds.
 - Measurements by "reliable referring doctor" are allowed.
 - Take this opportunity to review the patient's notes to ensure you have recorded ALL surgeries and/or complications
 that have occurred since baseline assessment date.
