This is an automated reminder from the IPSOCG Coordinating Center.

In two weeks it will be time to record {{ month }} month OUTCOMES DATA (IOP and visual acuity) for your patient with
UUID {{ patient.uuid }} who you assessed on {{ patient.visual_acuity_date }}, and enrolled on {{ patient.created_at }}.

Outcome data can be recorded from {{ start_date }} ({{ month|add:-1 }} months from baseline assessment date), and MUST be
completed by {{ end_date }} ({{ month|add:1 }} months after baseline assessment date).
